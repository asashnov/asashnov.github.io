In 2013 I resisted myself to buy an Android phone because I was afraid
it will be too irritation for me. But I couldn't resist and buy one.

Now it is my personal digital assistent and English learning station.

Here are some links to apps I like:

 - [MePlayer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jayuins.movie.english.lite)
    Player with uniq features for a language learning: repeatings, echoing
    (recording you speak and playing it back to you so you may control yourself)
 - [ColorNotes]()
    Fast, lightweight notes and todo lists application.
 - [Maps.Me]()
    Uses OpenStreetMap data. Works well and can download detailed areas
    of your choise.
