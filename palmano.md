This project is still in pre-alpha stage.
I started writting it in Aug 2003 (month after I get Palm m105) but
I was very busy in my personal life so I could find time to acomplish it.
 
Platform: PalmOS 3.5
  
This is system sound editor for PalmOS 3.5 with on-screen piano keyboard.
Notes typed on screen goes into one-track MIDI file which can be used
as a system sound for alarms.
