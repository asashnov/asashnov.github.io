Simple cosmic shooter game written in Borland C++ Builder
and pure DirectX API long time ago in education purpuse.
This is first my playable game for PC.
Source code of this game is the night mare. I try to port it
to SDL and was fail.
Possible I rewrite it in C++/SDL or Pyton/PyGame soon.
 
 
Platform: Windows, DirectX
