i8080 emulator

![i8080emu main window](img/i8080emu.png) 
 
I wrote this emulator as my diplom work for engeneer degree in Jan-May 2003
under Borland C++ Builder. Why I not start write it in GTK an begin?
Seems because I have no experience in Linux/GTK at that time and aftaid
of fails. Also I still not know so usable help system as WinHelp.
 
 
Platform: Windows
 
 
I still hope I can rewrite it using Qt, GTK+ or wxWindow user interface library
for make it cross platform compatibility.
