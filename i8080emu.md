i8080 emulator

![i8080emu main window](img/i8080emu.png) 
 
I wrote this emulator as my graduate work for an engeneer degree
in Jan-May 2003 using Borland C++ Builder 5.

Why didn't I start writting it in GTK+ at the begining?
At the moment I have no experience with GTK+ / Qt and fear of failure
stopped me. Another reason was I didn't know a good cross-platform help system
so Help file is written entirely in RTF for help compiler.

Platform: Windows

I still hope I can rewrite it using Qt, GTK+ or wxWindow user interface library
for make it cross platform compatibility.
