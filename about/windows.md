Software for windows

  Since I've got permanent LAN internet connection (May 2006) I stop use windows at home also
because the risk of getting exposed by malware was so high.
But many friends and people around continued using Windows for different reasons.
So I dedicate this page to them for getting familiar with great open source software
which is available under Windows as well as on Linux.
Here are some links:
