Here the list of books I have read programming about:
 
 
 * Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie, The C programming Language. 
Full description of C programming language in depth by language creators.

 * Brian W.Kernighan, Rob Pike, The Practice of Programming. 
A lot of usefull practice recomendation for coding, testing and
debugging in general, not only for some particular language.
 
 
 * Bjarne Stroustrup, The C++ Programming Language. 
Exelent book about C++ language from creator of this language!

 * Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides, Design Patterns. 
Authors describe a lot of aspects of object-oriented programming
which is usefull in any application development.

 * Scott Maxwell, Linux kernel in commentaries. 
This was an interesting book about internals of Linux 2.4
2/3 of this book is printed kernel source code. Some code is still there
in Linux 4.0 !
