ZX real tape to .tap converter
---

Like many others I had this the most world-popular 8-bit computer.

When I bought my first PC compatible computer I asked myself: what am I
going to do with all the 5'' disks and tapes I have?

Emulator was not a problem, but how to migrate my own stuff?

Disks was not a problem also. I just connected my 5'' spectrum floppy
to PC computer and used **dd** Linux command to do block-to-block copy.

For tapes the solution was a bit tricky. I took a part of **spectemu**
and made it a separate application. It converts an audio file to .tap file
which can be used in any specy emulator.
