Vision
---

Til the age of 22 y.o. I had 100% vision. My be because I had poor
monitor that scares my eyes away of screen every time I tried to read
within 20 minutes. Since I bought my first TFT display I started to use
it intensively. Also I started to work as a computer programmer.

Five years later at age 27 I went to get my driver's license and it turn
out that my vision degrade to 20% (I was able to see only first two lines
in the table). It was miopia -1.75 D for both eyes.

I've got my first eye wear -0.5 D. Doctor said it's just to get started
and within 6 month I should get my second -1.0 D glasses.

Of cause I wasn't satisfied with it and started finding for a solution.

I started my findings with this idea: short-sight people are usualy young
and the problem is hyper-tonus of eye muscules. Far-sight people are 45+
and the problem is weakness of eye muscules. So what if I start to wear
glasses with + now to get my eyes relaxed? Is it possible? Is it harmless?

And google did his job. It pointed me out to a patent of Dr. Ermoshin where
he describes his glasses. Besides + dioptries it also has prizm component
because our eyes not only accomodate, they convergent also- both eyes
moves to nouse. There is a theory that accomodation and convergention is
done by the same muscules.

So I started to use +0.5D glasses with prism 2.0 which I bought at antiochki.ru
This glasses gets work to accomodate for my eyes so my eyes getting less
tired. Breaks are also important. Since 2012 I switched to +0.75 because
my vision was -1.0 and I though I can gain more progress. But probably
it is not the case: in my opinion +0.5 my be your first and only glasses.
Now (2016) at age 35 my vision is -0.5 D for both eyes.
