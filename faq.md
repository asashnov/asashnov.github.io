<p>Q: <strong>For why this page?</strong></p>
 
A: This page exist for publish my creative in one place in network.
Most usefull and pupular projects will be placed to separate sites
if it becomes necessary.
 
<p>Q: <strong>How this site generated?</strong></p>
 
A: For a long time (2008-2014) HTML appearance was build from
macroses with GNU m4 macro processor plus few tiny shell scripts.
This idea came from the article in Linux Journal:

Hovewer in 2015 I decided to switch to Jekyll for few reasons:
(1) my static HTML hosting at hosting.qip.ru stopped working
(2) github.com offers free hosting on its github.io site and
(3) I wanted to learn a bit of MarkDown format.
