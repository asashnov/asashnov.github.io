  Sashnov Alexander's homepage
  
In the past it was a Makefile which converts .m4 files directly to .html
But since 2016 hosting at http://sashnov.nm.ru/ was closed and I decide
to move my page to pages.github.com  The service uses Jekyll for server-
side generation of .html files out of .md (MarkDown) files.

It seemed easy to convert my .m4 files to .md so I have a go.
It is hard to install the latest version of Jekyll so I use
the official docker container jekyll/jekyll.

Jekyll’s rules
    Any file in the source directory is copied directly into the site directory.
    Unless the file that has a YAML header. These files can make use of the Liquid templating language.
    Unless the file is in _posts. These files build up a data object representing all of your site’s content that can be referenced when templating.
    Posts can specify a permalink to generate a page at a different location than where the post resides in the source directory.
