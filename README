  Sashnov Alexander's homepage
  
In the past it was a Makefile which converts .m4 files directly to .html
But since 2016 hosting at http://sashnov.nm.ru/ was closed and I decide
to move my page to pages.github.com  The service uses Jekyll for server-
side generation of .html files out of .md (MarkDown) files.

It seemed easy to convert my .m4 files to .md so I have a go.
It is hard to install the latest version of Jekyll so I use
the official docker container jekyll/jekyll.


  Getting started

1. Install base tools:
make		GNU make utilite
bash		Shell (or any other shell like sh)
m4		GNU macroprocessor
awk		GNU awk interpreter (gawk)
ImageMagick	Image processing tool


2. install Docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/

3. docker pull jekyll/jekyll:pages
   ( :pages tag is the closest to GitHub Pages version)

   See for help: https://github.com/jekyll/docker/wiki
       https://github.com/jekyll/docker/wiki/Usage:-Running
   
4. Build and run

  make clean
  make

  docker run --rm --label=jekyll --volume=$(pwd):/srv/jekyll \
    -it -p 127.0.0.1:4000:4000 jekyll/jekyll:pages


5. Open in browser http://localhost:4000/
