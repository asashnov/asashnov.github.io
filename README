  Sashnov Alexander's homepage
  
In the past it was a Makefile which converts .m4 files directly to .html
But since 2016 hosting at http://sashnov.nm.ru/ was closed and I decide
to move my page to pages.github.com  The service uses Jekyll for server-
side generation of .html files out of .md (MarkDown) files.

It seemed easy to convert my .m4 files to .md so I have a go.
It is hard to install the latest version of Jekyll so I use
the official docker container jekyll/jekyll.


  Getting started

1. Install base tools:
make		GNU make utilite
bash		Shell (or any other shell like sh)
m4		GNU macroprocessor
awk		GNU awk interpreter (gawk)
ImageMagick	Image processing tool
