Level Editor

![Level Editor screenshot](img/levedit.png) 
 
My second serious project written on PC in 2000.
It is barely an editor of 1000x1000 tile map (8 bit per each tile).

I used it in my further projects: ddungeon and another experiments.

At the time I knew nothing about cross-platform programming
so file format is very staight-forward: I just created C-structure
and dump it directly into file, followed by pay-load data.
Be avare of it when using created file with compilers and platforms
differ than Borland C++ 5 and Windows.

Platform: Windows

If you know a good cross-platform format for storing tile map
please let me know. It would be kind of level editor for such games
like Dizzy, LodeRunner and other 2D platformers.

  editor for creating tiles and sprites and a map editor for designing

  The Clean Game Library is a complete development system for 2D
  games (arcade, side scrollers, platform games), using the functional
  language Clean. Allthough Clean is not easy to learn (it's very
  different from imperative languages, such as Pascal and C), once you
  have mastered programming in Clean, you can easily create games with
  the Clean Game Library.
