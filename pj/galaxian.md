Galaxian

![Galaxian screenshot](img/galaxian.png) 
 
Simple cosmic shooter game written in Borland C++ Builder
using pure DirectX API at the time I was getting myself familiar with the API in 2000. 
This was my first my playable game for PC.
Source code of this game is the night mare. I tryed to port it to SDL and failed
because couldn't understand my _spagetty code_

Possible I will rewrite it with C++/SDL or Pyton/PyGame one day.

Platform: Windows, DirectX
