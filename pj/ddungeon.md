Danger Dungeon

![Danger dungeon screenshot](img/ddungeon.png) 
 
This is my second playable game. It's written using Borland C++
(like Galaxian) but uses NukeDX wrapper instead of using DirectX API directly.
The game is simplified Loderunner clone (without floor breaking).
I used my another application as a level designer:
[Level Editor](levedit.html) which I wrote long time before of writting this game.

Platform: Windows, DirectX

NOTE: it runs only in 16-bit color display mode. So in order to run it
you have to open you display and monitor settings and choose 16-bit colors mode.
