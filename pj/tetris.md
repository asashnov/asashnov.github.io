![Tetris gameplay with single opponent](img/tetris.png)

This was my first serious programm on PC. I made it at first course of
the university in my spare time using computer in a lab (I did not own it yet).

Singularity of this implementation is computer opponents (one or two)
which play in parallel in their own fields but you may see how they do it.

Programming environment: Borland C++ 3.11

Platform: DOS
